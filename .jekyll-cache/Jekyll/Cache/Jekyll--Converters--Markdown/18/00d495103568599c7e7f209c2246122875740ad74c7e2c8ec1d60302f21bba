I"L<p>So you are making your first face beautifier<strong>©</strong> app and it’s about time to upload some images to a server. The backend person asks you to do it via a type of HTTP POST request known as <code class="highlighter-rouge">multipart/form-data</code>. Soon you come to realise that <code class="highlighter-rouge">URLSession</code> does not provide you with an out of the box <code class="highlighter-rouge">URLRequest</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">DataTask</code> for this specific task, despite the fact that this is a very standard way of uploading data.</p>
